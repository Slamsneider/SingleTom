# SingleTom
## A GPT tool (client) using OpenAI's API

**SingleTom** is a tutorial project that combines HTML and JavaScript to create a local HTML client. The client utilizes OpenAI's GPT API, eliminating the need for a server, node.js, or Python. To get started, simply open the HTML file in your browser.

You will need your personal OpenAI API-KEY. You can obtain it by visiting this link: [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

The **SingleTom** client is designed to be a simple demo and serve as a source of inspiration. Feel free to use the code as-is or expand upon it to create your own unique implementation. If you have basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript and are interested in learning how to leverage OpenAI's API then this project is for you.

Please note that this project is intended for local use and learning purposes. If you were to use it on a public server, be cautious as your API key would be exposed to the world.

It's important to clarify that, even being useful as-is, this project is not a fully-fledged application. However, with some modifications, you can transform it into one if desired.

NOTE: When one or more text files are drag/dropped onto the 'history' textarea, their contents are read and appended to the textarea so you can 'talk with them'.

  <summary>üì¶ Installation</summary>
  
  1. Press the green "Code" button on the project page and choose "Download ZIP" or [download here](https://github.com/Slamsneider/SingleTom/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
  2. Once downloaded, unzip the `html` folder to your desired location.
  3. **RENAME** `apikeys.js.RENAME_AND_ADD_API_KEY` to `apikeys.js` and open the file in a text editor.
  4. Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE` with your OpenAI API key.
  5. Save the changes made in the `apikeys.js` file.
  6. Now, open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the application.

  NOTE: Do **NOT** rename or add your api key to the `apicall.php.RENAME_AND_ADD_API_KEY` file unless you (optional) intend to run the application ONLINE from a PHP server. (see below)

<details>
  <summary>üìö Code Structure</summary>
  
  - `index.html`: Main HTML file for the application.
  - `apikeys.js`: Contains the API key for OpenAI's API. (Never upload this file anywhere)
  - `models.js`: OpenAI Models.
  - `agents.js`: Agent definitions. (make/add your own)
  - `functions.js`: Main functionality of the application.
  - `dropTextFile.js`: Functionality for drag and drop text files to the history.
  - `styles.css`: CSS styles for the application.
  - `apicall.php`: Just ignore this file if not using a PHP server. (see below)

  <summary>üíª Workflow using SingleTom as a tool</summary>
  
  You do not need to supply all documents when working with code, normally you would only have the essential parts in history (memory) or in your prompt.

  But if need be then it handles multiple documents and can work with them.

  Here an example where I threw all **SingleTom**'s scripts in history and asked a question. I added all the 7 scripts just for good measure:

  ![image](https://github.com/Slamsneider/SingleTom/assets/192285/129ce56a-48be-4a0f-a452-23e882bde7d6)

  This example is only to somehow illustrate the flexibillity of this workflow. Also note the tokenuse where `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` is a life saver.

  TIPS:
  * The implemented agents are just simple examples, use your (system) prompt engineering skills to make your own, better agents.
  * If you do not "ADD TO HISTORY", eg. if you don't need the answer in further communication, then you save tokens down the line.
  * Remember to "ADD TO HISTORY" if you need the answer in further communication.
  * If you need to have a lot of text in history, then use `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` as it has 16k tokens available for each request.
  * Treat the HISTORY as a scratchpad (literally), it's not a freakin' chatbot.
  * There is no right or wrong way to do it, just do it your way.
  * If you get an error because there was not enough tokens then delete some stuff in history and try again.
  * If `finished_reason` is "length" (not complete) then you can continue the response by 'adding it to history', and then send a new prompt with the word "continue".

  <summary>üß† About OpenAI Models and Tokens</summary>
  
  Each model have a different total tokens available for the inference (request). One token is approximately 4 characters.

  As example then `gpt-3.5-turbo` has 4096 tokens available for each request.

  When sending a request, the token count consists of the following components:

  - System prompt
  - Conversation history
  - User prompt
  - `max_tokens` parameter value

  The sum of these components must be less than the total tokens available for the model, or else an error will occur.
  ### max_tokens (parameter)
  The `max_tokens` parameter determines how many tokens should be reserved for the response.

  ### finish_reason (output)
  The `finish_reason` indicates the reason why the response ended. It can be either "stop" or "length". "stop" means that the response had a 'normal' run, while "length" indicates that the response reached the `max_tokens` limit and is incomplete. If so, then to continue the response, you can use the word "continue" as the next prompt.

  ### temperature (parameter)
  The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the response. Lower values will result in more predictable responses, while higher values will result in more surprising responses (hallucinations).

<details><summary>ü§ñ Agents (Make your own!)</summary>
There is 4 example agents for inspiration (See agents.js). - You are encouraged to make your own agents. System-prompt engineering is not the scope of this tutorial project.

- SingleTom: A simple agent
- Pirate: A pirate by the name of Dorothy
- Marvin: The Paranoid Android from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
- Children Books: Prompt desired reader age, number of pages, and theme to make a children book

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
  
  Do not use this application on a public server as it will expose your API key to the world. This application is intended for 'local' use only. (see below though)

<details>
  <summary>üåê How to run this ONLINE from a server?</summary>
  
  * php
  * python
  * node.js
  * whatever...

  **I repeat that this tutorial project is aimed at local use only and ONLINE deployment is not the scope of this tutorial project.**

  The important thing is to not expose your API key to the world. So instead you make an api call to your server that in turn can do the OpenAI API CALLs for you while not exposing the API key to the user.

  ### Example using PHP
  This ad hoc example implementation is using a PHP server, but you can (change the scripts and) use whatever server you want.

  If **SingleTom** can not find the variable `openai_apikey` from the `apikeys.js` file, then it will use `apicall.php` to do the API CALLs instead. (Intended functionality)

  Calling OpenAI locally (directly from your browser client) is faster and less prone to errors, but the client then would expose your API key. So instead you make an api call to your server that can do the OpenAI API calls for you without compromising your API key.

  You can easily convert the api call in `apicall.php` to a Python script or Node.js script and serve the OpenAI api call from that environment instead. Maybe even ask SingleTom to help with that. Atm. the only thing that needs a server request is the API CALLs to obfuscate your API key from online predators.

  So to run this ONLINE on a PHP server, then you need to do the following:
  * RENAME `apicall.php.RENAME_AND_ADD_API_KEY` to `apicall.php` and open the file in a text editor.
  * Add your API key to the `apicall.php` file and save it.
  * Upload all files **EXCEPT `apikeys.js`**  from the `html` folder to your PHP server.
  * Navigate to the index.html on the server and you are good to go.

  Then when the online HTML client can not find the `openai_apikey` variable from `apikeys.js`, it will use `apicall.php` to do the API CALLs instead. (Intended functionality)

  The reason for this implementation is that the SingleTon client is intended for local use only. But you occasionally want to share your extended and improved version with someone, and then you can just upload it to a server and it will work. IMPORTANT: Do not upload the `apikeys.js` file!

  Whatever you do, then do not expose your API key to the world.
